    "resultat": "\"Devise en France\" translates to \"Currency (or motto) in France.\"\n\nIn France, the official currency is the Euro (€). It was adopted in 1999 and became the sole currency in circulation in 2002. The Euro is represented by the symbol € and is divided into 100 cents. It is widely used for daily transactions, both in physical form (coins and banknotes) and through electronic payments.\n\nAside from currency, France also has a motto, which is \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\" (in French: \"Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité\"). This motto reflects the values of the French Republic and is a fundamental principle in French society and governance. It encapsulates the ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity for all citizens."

    "resultat": "\"Devise\" in French can have two meanings:\n\n1. As a noun, \"devise\" refers to a motto or slogan. It is a short phrase or sentence that expresses a guiding principle or belief. For example, the national motto of France is \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\" (\"Liberté, égalité, fraternité\" in French). This motto reflects the values and principles of the French Republic.\n\n2. As a verb, \"devise\" means to conceive or invent something, usually with ingenuity or creativity. In this sense, it would be used in a sentence like \"Il a devisé une nouvelle technologie\" (He devised a new technology).\n\nIt's worth noting that \"devise\" can also mean \"inheritance\" in English, but this usage is less common in French. The more common term for \"inheritance\" in French is \"héritage.\""
